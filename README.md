# Compiler fall 1400
Compiler design project  
## TODO list
-----
* initialize table
  - define useful sets (letter, digit, symbol, whitespace, after_id_acc, after_num_acc)
  - construct table of states and chars.
  - note that each state must go to the correspending state by any char (table must not contain NULL)   

* writing tests
